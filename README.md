# Personalized AI chatbot version of me

Demo: https://chloewang-200.github.io/

This is my first time working with LLM models and learning about how it works. This project took me a whole day of grinding, learning new concepts and trying out different libraries & APIs. Feel free to use my code! ðŸ˜Š

This is the backend part of the chatbot. The frontend along with more info can be found at https://github.com/chloewang-200/chloe-bot-backend
